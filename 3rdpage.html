         Harleen ðŸ’–,
          <br />
          I want to promise you that there will be no day of your life when you
          will not find me by your side. There will be no day when I will not be
          loving you and pampering you because you mean the world to me. Even if 
          might've happened, you make me want to be the best for you because you
          are the best for me. I am grateful that you didnt let me abandon us.
          I love you, my baby. I will adore every bit of you because you deserve
          everything.
        </p>
